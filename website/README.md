## The website

!!THIS IS TEMPLATE WEBSITE THAT HASN'T IMPLEMENTED SHERLOCK YET CONTACT ME TO COOPERATE!!

The plan for this website is to implement all the sherlock functions and help the user find usernames faster without the need to download the project and use the command line.

## What is completed:
* I created the basic template for the site which icludes the index.html,the result.html and the main.css files.
* I completed the creation of the dark mode in the darkmode.js file.
* And I offer the choice to download a txt file with the results.

## What in not completed:
* I did not manage to implement the sherlock algorithm to the website. Everything that is shown is an example of the finished project.
* I want to find a sponsor in order to buy a domain and make the website public.

## Contribution:
Everyone is welcome to help to finish the project. If you are interested contact me in order to cooperate.
I am not interested in making any profit, i am just curious to see how many people are interested to find usernames across varius platforms.
Also, i want to learn how a python algorithm like sherlock can be used to search with a website.
